- mcrypt 
- zip
- composer (avaiable globally)
- xdebug (enabled with `-e PHP_XDEBUG=1`)

# App Setup

This docker image is built for `index.php` file being in the `public/` 
directory. `mod_rewrite` is enabled.

At a minimum, you will want this in your `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM socialengine/php-apache:5.6

COPY . /app

RUN composer install
```

Then you can build & run your app in the docker container.

If you want to enable xdebug:

```bash
$ docker run -e PHP_XDEBUG=1 [your image]
```

See [example](example/) for further info. 

## Check Links

A lot of times, your depedant services aren't ready to go as fast as your app

For that, there's a `check_docker_link` command that will check TCP to make 
sure its up

```
Usage: check_docker_link <name> <addr> <port>

# Example
if check_docker_link "mysql" "${DB_1_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR}" "${DB_1_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT}"; then
    export MYSQL_HOST=${DB_1_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR}
    export MYSQL_PORT=${DB_1_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT}
fi
```
